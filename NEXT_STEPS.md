## 📋 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Setup Cron Jobs (5 minutes)

**Action**: Schedule automated backups and monitoring

```bash
# Open crontab
crontab -e

# Add these lines:
0 2 * * * /tmp/webapp/Titan/scripts/backup.sh >> /home/ubuntu/titan-backup.log 2>&1
0 * * * * /tmp/webapp/Titan/scripts/monitor.sh >> /home/ubuntu/titan-monitor.log 2>&1

# Save and exit
```

**Verification**:
```bash
crontab -l
```

**Documentation**: See `CRON_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

---

### 2. Test Backup Restoration (10 minutes)

**Action**: Verify backups can be restored

```bash
# Create test backup
/tmp/webapp/Titan/scripts/backup.sh

# List backups
ls -lh /home/ubuntu/titan-backups/

# Test database backup integrity
cd /home/ubuntu/titan-backups
pg_restore --list db_backup_*.dump | head -20
```

**Documentation**: See `BACKUP_SETUP.md`

---

### 3. Monitor System for 24 Hours

**Action**: Verify automated systems work correctly

```bash
# Check monitoring logs after 1 hour
tail -f /home/ubuntu/titan-monitor.log

# Check backup logs after 24 hours
tail -f /home/ubuntu/titan-backup.log

# View real-time dashboard
/tmp/webapp/Titan/scripts/status-dashboard.sh
```
